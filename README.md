# Netflix_Tableau
As a data enthusiast, I've always been fascinated by the streaming industry and how it's transformed the way we consume entertainment. So, I decided to dive into the world of Netflix and explore its vast collection of TV shows and movies. Using Tableau, I analyzed a dataset of Netflix content to create an interactive dashboard that reveals some interesting insights.

My dashboard displays the most popular shows on Netflix, based on the number of views and their ratings. It also shows the distribution of TV shows and movies by genre and country of origin, allowing viewers to see how Netflix's content library has evolved over the years. By using filters, users can drill down to specific categories or time periods to uncover more detailed information.

Overall, my Netflix dashboard provides a unique and engaging way to explore the streaming giant's extensive content library. I'm excited to share my insights and hope to inspire others to explore the fascinating world of data analytics and visualization.
